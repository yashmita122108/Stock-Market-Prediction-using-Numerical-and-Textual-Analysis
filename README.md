# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis

In the ever-evolving landscape of financial markets, accurate stock price prediction is a paramount concern for investors, traders, and financial analysts alike. In pursuit of enhanced forecasting precision, we embark on a journey into the realm of Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis. By combining these two streams of data, we aim to develop a predictive model that not only captures the inherent patterns in stock price movements but also factors in the impact of news sentiment on market dynamics. Through this task, we seek to provide investors and financial professionals with a valuable tool for making informed decisions in the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable world of stock trading. The approach showcases the potential of fusing traditional financial analysis with cutting-edge natural language processing techniques, offering a comprehensive framework for more accurate and robust stock price predictions.
